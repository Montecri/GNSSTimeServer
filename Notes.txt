The code in two files, main.cpp and definitions.h. The seoncd OLED display
doesn't have to be present. The code works without it. Each time an NTP request
is received the second display shows the client's IP address and the time
when the response was sent.

The I2C address of the second display has to be changed by relocating a 
resistor on its circuit board. It's a tiny surface-mount part and this isn't 
easy to do. There should be a graphic on the board that shows where the resistor
should be placed to choose which address you want.

Also use the appropriate U8g2 library constructor for your displays. It's in
the definitions.h file. SSD1306 displays don't work properly with the SH1106 
constructor. 

There is provision to turn the displays on and off. This can be done by
connecting a PIR motion sensor to the A0 pin on the NodeMCU. You can also 
just connect a SPDT switch to A0 to connect it either to +3.3 volts or ground.

If you don't want to turn off the displays either connect A0 permanently to
+3.3 volts or comment out the setPowerSave code in the UpdateDisplay() function.
